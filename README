== Using radiant-base

This fork of Radiant provides an alternative way to get started on development of
Radiant-based websites. While the master branch just tracks the Radiant repo, the
small branch adds a number of essential extensions that most Radiant sites can't
be without (in my opinion!) and the medium branch adds a number a more advanced
extensions for larger Radiant sites.

=== Getting started

1. Clone the repository from Github:
    % git clone -o base git://github.com/RSpace/radiant.git [local directory name]

2. Set up a branch to track your prefered Radiant setup - I use "application" as a name for that branch
    % git branch --track [name of local branch] base/[small|medium]
    % git branch --track application base/medium # As an example of my preferred setup

3. Initialize submodules with this command:
    % git submodule init
    
4. Follow the instructions in INSTALL to get the site up and running

== Welcome to Radiant

Radiant is a no-fluff, open source content management system designed for
small teams. It is similar to Textpattern or MovableType, but is a general
purpose content management system (not just a blogging engine).

Radiant features:

* An elegant user interface
* The ability to arrange pages in a hierarchy
* Flexible templating with layouts, snippets, page parts, and a custom tagging
  language (Radius: http://radius.rubyforge.org)
* A simple user management/permissions system
* Support for Markdown and Textile as well as traditional HTML (it's easy to
  create other filters)
* An advanced plugin system
* Operates in two modes: dev and production depending on the URL
* A caching system which expires pages every 5 minutes
* Built using Ruby on Rails
* And much more...
